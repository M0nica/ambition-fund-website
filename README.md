### Branch Name Conventions

When contributing, please fork this repository by clicking the ‚Äúfork‚Äù button at the top right. This creates your own copy of the repository where you‚Äôre able to make changes. Once you have forked the repository, please structure your branches using the following format.

`feature/task-description` - Feature branches are for all new feature work. The task description should be descriptive enough to quickly understand the work done in this branch. Please keep your features concise and ensure the work done in this branch directly relates to your task.

`fix/task-description` - Fix branches should be leveraged for bug fixes on existing features

`hotfix/task-description` - Hotfix branches should only ever be leveraged for _critical_ bug fixes that need attention immediately. This would only be use if there is a broken feature or bug on production that needs to be addressed urgently.
